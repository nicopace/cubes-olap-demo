CubesViewer - OLAP Visual Viewer and Explore Tool
=================================================

About
-----


CubesViewer is a visual, web-based tool application for exploring and analyzing
OLAP databases served by the Cubes OLAP Framework.

CubesViewer can be used for data exploration and data auditory, 
generation of reports, chart design and embedding, 
and as a (simple) company-wide analytics application.

CubesViewer is a visual interface for the 
open source [Cubes server](http://databrewery.org/cubes.html) (an OLAP server in Python). 
Purpose is to keep it simple and modular, leveraging the web services 
provided by Cubes.  


Features:

* Cube explorer providing drilldown and cut operations.
* Supports dimension hierarchies and date filtering.
* Several charts and diagrams can be created.
* View management, cloning, saving and sharing.
* User Interface allows for multiple views on-screen. 
* Multiple modes: explore, data series, chart, facts. 
* Undo / Redo.
* Multi-user.
* Shared wiki notes system to annotate cubes and views.
* Views can be embedded in other web sites.
* Modular and extensible.

Download
------------

CubesViewer requires a [Cubes Server](http://databrewery.org/cubes.html), configured and running, 
able to serve Cubes OLAP queries. 

* [CubesViewer version 0.9](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer/archive/v0.9.zip) support Cubes 0.10.x  
* Next CubesViewer version will be 0.10, supporting Cubes 1.0 

Requirements
------------

CubesViewer consists of two parts:

**CubesViewer Client** is a HTML5 application and can run directly in the browser.
It can run without server side support as a standalone application, and  
views can be embedded in other websites. Simply
download and open the src/htmlviews/gui.html file in your favourite browser.

The **full CubesViewer application** includes a server side Python Django application which supports features 
like sharing/saving and user notes. You need Django 1.3 in order to run it, but it is optional 
(only needed if you wish to use the full application with user authentication, user notes
or save/load/share support). 

Note that **your cubes model shall be configured** to add support for CubesViewer features like date 
filters and descriptions (see Documentation below). This is optional: CubesViewer will work, 
but some features like Date Filters will be missing. 

For further information, see the Documentation section below.

Documentation
-------------

This tool allows users to inspect the different dimensions, measures and
aggregated data in different ways, allowing you to build tables and charts
based on the analytical data available from the server.
