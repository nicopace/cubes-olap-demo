Aggregation Browsing and Aggregations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The main purpose of the Cubes framework is aggregation and browsing through
the aggregates. In this chapter we are going to demonstrate how basic
aggregation is done.

.. note::

    See the :mod:`backend` documentation for reference.

ROLAP with SQL backend
======================

Following examples will show:

* how to build a model programmatically
* how to create a model with flat dimensions
* how to aggregate whole cube
* how to drill-down and aggregate through a dimension

The example data used are `IBRD Balance Sheet`_ taken from `The World Bank`_.
Backend used for the examples is ``sql.browser``.

.. _IBRD Balance Sheet: https://raw.github.com/Stiivi/cubes/master/tutorial/data/IBRD_Balance_Sheet__FY2010.csv
.. _The World Bank: https://finances.worldbank.org/Accounting-and-Control/IBRD-Balance-Sheet-FY2010/e8yz-96c6)

Create a tutorial directory and download :download:`this example file 
<files/IBRD_Balance_Sheet__FY2010.csv>`.

Start with imports:

>>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
>>> from cubes.tutorial.sql import create_table_from_csv

.. note::

    Cubes comes with tutorial helper methods in ``cubes.tutorial``. It is
    advised not to use them in production, they are provided just to simplify
    learner's life.

Prepare the data using the tutorial helpers. This will create a table and
populate it with contents of the CSV file:

>>> engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data.sqlite')
... create_table_from_csv(engine,
...                       "data.csv",
...                       table_name="irbd_balance",
...                       fields=[
...                             ("category", "string"),
...                             ("category_label", "string"),
...                             ("subcategory", "string"),
...                             ("subcategory_label", "string"),
...                             ("line_item", "string"),
...                             ("year", "integer"),
...                             ("amount", "integer")],
...                       create_id=True
...                   )

Download the :download:`example model<files/model.json>` and save it.
Load the model:

>>> import cubes
>>> model = cubes.load_model("model.json")

Check whether the model is valid with ``model.is_valid()`` - should return
``True``.

>>> model.is_valid()
True

Create a workspace and get a :class:`browser<cubes.AggregationBrowser>`
instance (in this example it is :class:`SQL
backend<cubes.backends.star.SQLStarBrowser>`):

>>> workspace = cubes.create_workspace("sql.star", model, engine=engine)

Get a cube and :class:`browser<cubes.AggregationBrowser>` for the cube:

>>> cube = model.cube("irbd_balance")
>>> browser = workspace.browser(cube)

:class:`cell<cubes.Cell>` defines context of interest - part of the cube we
are looking at. We start with whole cube:

>>> cell = cubes.Cell(cube)

Compute the aggregate. Measure fields of :class:`aggregation
result<cubes.AggregationResult>` have aggregation suffix. Also a total record
count within the cell is included as ``record_count``.

>>> result = browser.aggregate(cell)
>>> result.summary["record_count"]
62
>>> result.summary["amount_sum"]
1116860

Now try some drill-down by `year` dimension:

>>> result = browser.aggregate(cell, drilldown=["year"])
>>> for record in result.drilldown:
...     print record
{u'record_count': 31, u'amount_sum': 550840, u'year': 2009}
{u'record_count': 31, u'amount_sum': 566020, u'year': 2010}

Drill-dow by item category:

>>> result = browser.aggregate(cell, drilldown=["item"])
>>> for record in result.drilldown:
...     print record
{u'item.category': u'a', u'item.category_label': u'Assets', u'record_count': 32, u'amount_sum': 558430}
{u'item.category': u'e', u'item.category_label': u'Equity', u'record_count': 8, u'amount_sum': 77592}
{u'item.category': u'l', u'item.category_label': u'Liabilities', u'record_count': 22, u'amount_sum': 480838}

Aggregations and Aggregation Result
-----------------------------------

Aggregate types depend on the backend, however there is at least one that
should be supported by all backends: `sum`. The SQL StarBrowser supports also
`min`, `max` and `avg`. In some databases, such as PostgreSQL, `stddev` and
`variance` can be used.

Relevant aggregations for a measure can be specified in the model description:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "measures": [
        {
            "name": "amount",
            "aggregations": ["sum", "min", "max"]
        }
    ]

The resulting aggregated attribute name will be constructed from the measure
name and aggregation suffix, for example the mentioned *amount* will have
three aggregates in the result: `amount_sum`, `amount_min` and `amount_max` in
the case described above.

Result of aggregation is a structure containing: `summary` - summary for the
aggregated cell, `drilldown` - drill down cells, if was desired, and
`total_cell_count` - total cells in the drill down, regardless of pagination. 

Cell Details
============

When we are browsing a cube, the cell provides current browsing context. For
aggregations and selections to happen, only keys and some other internal
attributes are necessary. Those can not be presented to the user though. For
example we have geography path (`country`, `region`) as ``['sk', 'ba']``,
however we want to display to the user `Slovakia` for the country and
`Bratislava` for the region. We need to fetch those values from the data
store.  Cell details is basically a human readable description of the current
cell.

For applications where it is possible to store state between aggregation
calls, we can use values from previous aggregations or value listings. Problem
is with web applications - sometimes it is not desirable or possible to store
whole browsing context with all details. This is exact the situation where
fetching cell details explicitly might come handy.

.. note::

    The Original browser added cut information in the summary, which was ok
    when only point cuts were used. In other situations the result was
    undefined and mostly erroneous.

The cell details are now provided separately by method
:func:`cubes.AggregationBrowser.cell_details()` which has Slicer HTTP
equivalent ``/cell`` or ``{"query":"detail", ...}`` in ``/report`` request
(see the :doc:`server documentation<server>` for more information).

For point cuts, the detail is a list of dictionaries for each level. For
example our previously mentioned path ``['sk', 'ba']`` would have details
described as:

.. code-block:: javascript

    [
        {
            "geography.country_code": "sk",
            "geography.country_name": "Slovakia",
            "geography.something_more": "..."
            "_key": "sk",
            "_label": "Slovakia"
        },
        {
            "geography.region_code": "ba",
            "geography.region_name": "Bratislava",
            "geography.something_even_more": "...",
            "_key": "ba",
            "_label": "Bratislava"
        }
    ]
    
You might have noticed the two redundant keys: `_key` and `_label` - those
contain values of a level key attribute and level label attribute
respectively. It is there to simplify the use of the details in presentation
layer, such as templates. Take for example doing only one-dimensional
browsing and compare presentation of "breadcrumbs":

.. code-block:: python

    labels = [detail["_label"] for detail in cut_details]

Which is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    levels = dimension.hierarchy().levels()
    labels = []
    for i, detail in enumerate(cut_details):
        labels.append(detail[level[i].label_attribute.ref()])

Note that this might change a bit: either full detail will be returned or just
key and label, depending on an option argument (not yet decided).

Hierarchies, levels and drilling-down
=====================================

* how to create a hierarchical dimension
* how to do drill-down through a hierarchy
* detailed level description

We are going to use very similar data as in the previous examples. Difference 
is in two added columns: category code and sub-category code. They are simple 
letter codes for the categories and subcategories. Download :download:`this 
example file <files/IBRD_Balance_Sheet__FY2010.csv>`.

Hierarchy
---------

Some :class:`dimensions<cubes.model.Dimension>` can have multiple 
:class:`levels<cubes.model.Level>` forming a 
:class:`hierarchy<cubes.model.Hierarchy>`. For example dates have year, month, 
day; geography has country, region, city; product might have category, 
subcategory and the product.

.. note:

    Cubes supports multiple hierarchies, for example for date you might have 
    year-month-day or year-quarter-month-day. Most dimensions will have one 
    hierarchy, though.

In our example we have the `item` dimension with three levels of hierarchy: 
*category*, *subcategory* and *line item*:

.. figure:: images/cubes-tutorial03-hierarchy.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

    `Item` dimension hierarchy.

The levels are defined in the model:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "levels": [
        {
            "name":"category",
            "label":"Category",
            "attributes": ["category"]
        },
        {
            "name":"subcategory",
            "label":"Sub-category",
            "attributes": ["subcategory"]
        },
        {
            "name":"line_item",
            "label":"Line Item",
            "attributes": ["line_item"]
        }
    ]

.. comment:

    FIXME: the following paragraph is referencing some "previous one", that is
    something from second tutorial blog post.

You can see a slight difference between this model description and the
previous one: we didn't just specify level names and didn't let cubes to
fill-in the defaults. Here we used explicit description of each level. `name`
is level identifier, `label` is human-readable label of the level that can be
used in end-user applications and `attributes` is list of attributes that
belong to the level. The first attribute, if not specified otherwise, is the
key attribute of the level.

Other level description attributes are `key` and `label_attribute``. The `key`
specifies attribute name which contains key for the level. Key is an id
number, code or anything that uniquely identifies the dimension level.
`label_attribute` is name of an attribute that contains human-readable value
that can be displayed in user-interface elements such as tables or charts.

Preparation
-----------

.. comment:

    FIXME: include the data loading code here

Again, in short we need:

* data in a database
* logical model (see :download:`model file<files/model_03.json>`) prepared
  with appropriate mappings
* denormalized view for aggregated browsing (optional)

Drill-down
----------

Drill-down is an action that will provide more details about data. Drilling 
down through a dimension hierarchy will expand next level of the dimension. It 
can be compared to browsing through your directory structure.

We create a function that will recursively traverse a dimension hierarchy and 
will print-out aggregations (count of records in this example) at the actual 
browsed location.

**Attributes**

* cell - cube cell to drill-down
* dimension - dimension to be traversed through all levels
* path - current path of the `dimension`

Path is list of dimension points (keys) at each level. It is like file-system 
path.

.. code-block:: python

    def drill_down(cell, dimension, path=[]):

Get dimension's default hierarchy. Cubes supports multiple hierarchies, for 
example for date you might have year-month-day or year-quarter-month-day. Most 
dimensions will have one hierarchy, thought.

.. code-block:: python

    hierarchy = dimension.hierarchy()

*Base path* is path to the most detailed element, to the leaf of a tree, to
the fact. Can we go deeper in the hierarchy?

.. code-block:: python

    if hierarchy.path_is_base(path):
        return

Get the next level in the hierarchy. `levels_for_path` returns list of levels
according to provided path. When `drilldown` is set to `True` then one more
level is returned.

.. code-block:: python

    levels = hierarchy.levels_for_path(path,drilldown=True)
    current_level = levels[-1]

We need to know name of the level key attribute which contains a path 
component. If the model does not explicitly specify key attribute for the 
level, then first attribute will be used:

.. code-block:: python

    level_key = dimension.attribute_reference(current_level.key)

For prettier display, we get name of attribute which contains label to be 
displayed for the current level. If there is no label attribute, then key 
attribute is used.

.. code-block:: python

    level_label = dimension.attribute_reference(current_level.label_attribute)

We do the aggregation of the cell... 

.. note::

    Shell analogy: Think of ``ls $CELL`` command in commandline, where 
    ``$CELL`` is a directory name. In this function we can think of ``$CELL`` 
    to be same as current working directory (``pwd``)

.. code-block:: python

    result = browser.aggregate(cell, drilldown=[dimension])

    for record in result.drilldown:
        print "%s%s: %d" % (indent, record[level_label], record["record_count"])
        ...

And now the drill-down magic. First, construct new path by key attribute value 
appended to the current path:

.. code-block:: python

        drill_path = path[:] + [record[level_key]]

Then get a new cell slice for current path:

.. code-block:: python

        drill_down_cell = cell.slice(dimension, drill_path)

And do recursive drill-down:

.. code-block:: python

        drill_down(drill_down_cell, dimension, drill_path)

The whole recursive drill down function looks like this:

.. figure:: images/cubes-tutorial03-drilldown_explained.png
    :align: center
    :width: 550px

    Recursive drill-down explained

Whole working example can be found in the ``tutorial`` sources.

Get the full cube (or any part of the cube you like):

.. code-block:: python

    cell = browser.full_cube()

And do the drill-down through the item dimension:

.. code-block:: python

    drill_down(cell, cube.dimension("item"))

The output should look like this::

    a: 32
        da: 8
            Borrowings: 2
            Client operations: 2
            Investments: 2
            Other: 2
        dfb: 4
            Currencies subject to restriction: 2
            Unrestricted currencies: 2
        i: 2
            Trading: 2
        lo: 2
            Net loans outstanding: 2
        nn: 2
            Nonnegotiable, nonintrest-bearing demand obligations on account of subscribed capital: 2
        oa: 6
            Assets under retirement benefit plans: 2
            Miscellaneous: 2
            Premises and equipment (net): 2

Note that because we have changed our source data, we see level codes instead 
of level names. We will fix that later. Now focus on the drill-down.

See that nice hierarchy tree?

Now if you slice the cell through year 2010 and do the exact same drill-down:

.. code-block:: python

    cell = cell.slice("year", [2010])
    drill_down(cell, cube.dimension("item"))

you will get similar tree, but only for year 2010 (obviously).

Level Labels and Details
------------------------

Codes and ids are good for machines and programmers, they are short, might
follow some scheme, easy to handle in scripts. Report users have no much use
of them, as they look cryptic and have no meaning for the first sight.

Our source data contains two columns for category and for subcategory: column
with code and column with label for user interfaces. Both columns belong to
the same dimension and to the same level. The key column is used by the
analytical system to refer to the dimension point and the label is just
decoration.

Levels can have any number of detail attributes. The detail attributes have no
analytical meaning and are just ignored during aggregations. If you want to do
analysis based on an attribute, make it a separate dimension instead.

So now we fix our model by specifying detail attributes for the levels:

.. figure:: images/cubes-tutorial03-hierarchy-detail.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

    Attribute details.

The model description is:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "levels": [
            {
                "name":"category",
                "label":"Category",
                "label_attribute": "category_label",
                "attributes": ["category", "category_label"]
            },
            {
                "name":"subcategory",
                "label":"Sub-category",
                "label_attribute": "subcategory_label",
                "attributes": ["subcategory", "subcategory_label"]
            },
            {
                "name":"line_item",
                "label":"Line Item",
                "attributes": ["line_item"]
            }
        ]
    }

Note the `label_attribute` keys. They specify which attribute contains label
to be displayed. Key attribute is by-default the first attribute in the list.
If one wants to use some other attribute it can be specified in
`key_attribute`.

Because we added two new attributes, we have to add mappings for them:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "mappings": { "item.line_item": "line_item",
                  "item.subcategory": "subcategory",
                  "item.subcategory_label": "subcategory_label",
                  "item.category": "category",
                  "item.category_label": "category_label" 
                 }

Now the result will be with labels instead of codes::

    Assets: 32
        Derivative Assets: 8
            Borrowings: 2
            Client operations: 2
            Investments: 2
            Other: 2
        Due from Banks: 4
            Currencies subject to restriction: 2
            Unrestricted currencies: 2
        Investments: 2
            Trading: 2
        Loans Outstanding: 2
            Net loans outstanding: 2
        Nonnegotiable: 2
            Nonnegotiable, nonintrest-bearing demand obligations on account of subscribed capital: 2
        Other Assets: 6
            Assets under retirement benefit plans: 2
            Miscellaneous: 2
            Premises and equipment (net): 2

Implicit hierarchy
------------------

Try to remove the last level *line_item* from the model file and see what 
happens. Code still works, but displays only two levels. What does that mean? 
If metadata - logical model - is used properly in an application, then 
application can handle most of the model changes without any application 
modifications. That is, if you add new level or remove a level, there is no 
need to change your reporting application.

Summary
-------

* hierarchies can have multiple levels
* a hierarchy level is identifier by a key attribute
* a hierarchy level can have multiple detail attributes and there is one
  special detail attribute: label attribute used for display in user
  interfaces

Multiple Hierarchies
====================

Dimension can have multiple hierarchies defined. To use specific hierarchy for
drilling down:

.. code-block:: python

    result = browser.aggregate(cell, drilldown = [("date", "dmy", None)])

The `drilldown` argument takes list of three element tuples in form:
(`dimension`, `hierarchy`, `level`). The `hierarchy` and `level` are optional.
If `level` is ``None``, as in our example, then next level is used. If
`hierarchy` is ``None`` then default hierarchy is used.

To sepcify hierarchy in cell cuts just pass `hierarchy` argument during cut
construction. For example to specify cut through week 15 in year 2010:

.. code-block:: python

    cut = cubes.PointCut("date", [2010, 15], hierarchy="ywd")

.. note::

    If drilling down a hierarchy and asking cubes for next implicit level the
    cuts should be using same hierarchy as drilldown. Otherwise exception is
    raised. For example: if cutting through year-month-day and asking for next
    level after year in year-week-day hierarchy, exception is raised.
